BankWise â€” Real-Time Fraud Detection with Explainable AI

BankWise is a real-time fraud detection system that flags suspicious bank transactions using an unsupervised model (Isolation Forest) combined with explainable AI (SHAP). Designed for real-world application, this project simulates the backend fraud detection process used by banks and financial platforms.


 Project Features

  Cleaned and engineered synthetic banking transaction data
  Trained an Isolation Forest to detect anomalies (fraud-like behavior)
  Used SHAP to explain why transactions were flagged
  Performed detailed EDA comparing normal vs suspicious transactions
  Ready for Streamlit dashboard or API integration
